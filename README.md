# Handwritten-Digit-Recognition
This is a machine learning project that involves building a model capable of
identifying and classifying handwritten digits (0â€“9) from images. Using the 
TensorFlow framework, the project leverages deep learning, particularly 
convolutional neural networks (CNNs), to accurately interpret and classify
digit images from datasets such as MNIST. The model undergoes extensive 
training, learning various features and patterns of digits, and is then
evaluated on test data to ensure its accuracy and robustness.
This project can be deployed in a web application using Flask, where users 
can upload an image of a digit, and the model will return the recognized 
digit in real-time. Such an application serves as a foundation for various 
handwriting  recognition systems and offers practical insights into the
power of machine learning in image processing tasks.
This project has many use cases such as:
1) Data Entry- Simplifies digitizing handwritten forms and documents,
reducing manual data entry work in industries like banking, insurance, and
healthcare.
3) Document Recognization- Recognizes handwritten numbers in documents and
books, aiding in archival and digitization efforts for historical records.
4) Smart Form Processing- Useful in applications where forms need to be
processed digitally, enabling recognition of handwritten responses, such as
surveys, exams, or registrations.
